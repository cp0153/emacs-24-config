;Basic setup for el-Get
;If you wish to ensure that El-Get is available when you load Emacs you can place the following elisp code in your init file. It will detect if el-get is already installed and install it if necessary.
;The addition of (el-get 'sync) in the code blocks below ensures that any currently installed packages will be initialized and any required packages will be installed.
;Calling the el-get function is covered in details in the full Info manual.
;Here is the basic setup to add to your user-init-file (.emacs):
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get/el-get")

(unless (require 'el-get nil 'noerror)
